# Camp Scout AI

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

**Camp Scout AI** helps campers discover real Northern California campgrounds using verified seed data from official park and agency sources.

## Epic CS-001: Real Seed Foundation

This epic establishes the real-data foundation for Camp Scout AI:

| Story | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Template Inventory | Done | Routing and component documentation in `docs/TEMPLATE_INVENTORY.md` |
| 2. Rebrand | Done | Camp Scout AI branding throughout the app |
| 3. Real Campground Seed Schema | Done | Schema in `src/data/campgroundSchema.js` |
| 4. Add Real Seed Campgrounds | Done | 20 real NorCal campgrounds in `src/data/campgrounds.js` |
| 5. Campground Browser | Done | Browse page at `/campgrounds` |
| 6. Search and Filters | Done | Search by name/region; filter by amenities and tags |
| 7. Detail Page With Sources | Done | Detail pages with official source and reservation links |
| 8. Availability Not Connected | Done | Notice on every card and detail page |

### Data rules

- **No mock campground data** — seed records use real parks with official `sourceUrl` values.
- **No invented availability** — live booking is not connected; users are directed to official portals.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

**GitHub Pages:** [https://sterapak.github.io/camp-scout-ai/campgrounds](https://sterapak.github.io/camp-scout-ai/campgrounds)

**Production (Fly.io):** [https://campscout.terapak.com/](https://campscout.terapak.com/)

> The old `/smartapp-ui-kit/` URL is no longer valid. Use `/camp-scout-ai/` on GitHub Pages or `/campgrounds` locally.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
npm run cypress:run   # requires dev server running
```

## Project Verification

Run all available quality checks and a production build with one command:

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

The script detects available npm scripts from `package.json` and runs, in order:

1. **Lint** — `npm run lint` (if defined)
2. **Unit tests** — `npm run test:unit`, `unit`, or `test` (first found)
3. **Coverage** — separate `coverage`, `test:coverage`, or `test:ci` script if defined; otherwise notes when `test` already includes coverage
4. **Production build** — `npm run build` (required)

Behavior:

- Stops immediately on the first failing step
- Prints clear pass/fail sections for each step
- Exits with a non-zero status on failure
- Performs no git, deployment, or release actions

Use this before commits and deployments to validate the project.

## Fly.io Deployment

`campscout.terapak.com` is served from Fly.io. A 502 Bad Gateway usually means the Fly app has no healthy machine running.

```bash
# One-time: install Fly CLI and authenticate
# https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/

# Build and run locally (root base path, dist/ output)
npm run build:fly
npm start

# Deploy to Fly (from repo root; requires fly auth)
fly deploy

# Set OpenAI secrets for live AI answers (optional; defaults to fake provider)
fly secrets set OPENAI_ANSWER_PROVIDER=openai OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

Health check: `GET /health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`.
