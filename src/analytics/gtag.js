/**
 * Google Analytics 4 (gtag.js) loader for the campscout SPA.
 *
 * Why a module and not a hardcoded <script> in index.html:
 *  - The Measurement ID comes from VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID at build time, so the
 *    same source works with no analytics locally (id unset -> everything no-ops)
 *    and with analytics in production.
 *  - The app sits behind a sign-in gate that lives OUTSIDE the router. Loading
 *    gtag here, from the app entry before render, means the initial page_view
 *    fires for EVERY landing — including visitors who bounce at the gate. That is
 *    exactly the traffic we care about (e.g. a LinkedIn click that never signs
 *    in), which router-level tracking alone would miss.
 *
 * A GA4 Measurement ID (G-XXXXXXX) is public by design — it ships in the page of
 * every site using GA — so it is a build arg, not a secret.
